            Setting font size in pixels is the
            best way to ensure that the type
            appears at the size you intended
            (because percentages and ems
            are more likely to vary if a user
            has changed the default size of
            text in their browser).
            Pixels are relative to the
            resolution of the screen, so the
            same type size will look larger
            when a screen has a resolution
            of 800x600 than it would when
            it is 1280x800.
            You can also use pt for point
            sizes instead of px for pixels, but
            you should only do this when
            creating style sheets for printerfriendly versions of pages
