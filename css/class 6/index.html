    <h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>
    <p>In normal flow, each block-level
        element sits on top of the next
        one. Since this is the default
        way in which browsers treat
        HTML elements, you do not
        need a CSS property to indicate
        that elements should appear
        in normal flow, but the syntax
        would be:
        position: static;
        I have not specified a width
        property for the heading
        element, so you can see how it
        stretches the width of the entire
        browser window by default.
        The paragraphs are restricted
        to 450 pixels wide. This shows
        how the elements in normal flow
        start on a new line even if they
        do not take up the full width of
        the browser window.</p>
